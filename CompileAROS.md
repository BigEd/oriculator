# Introduction #

This page describes how to compile Oricutron for "icaros desktop"

  * Either download and extract a source package from the [download page](http://www.petergordon.org.uk/oricutron/), or [check out](http://code.google.com/p/oriculator/source/checkout) the current subversion trunk.
  * Open a shell, and navigate to the Oricutron archive
  * For example type:
`unzip -a Downloads:Oricutron_src_v09.zip -d oricutron`

`cd oricutron`
  * Type:
`make`

Hopefully, an Oricutron executable should come out the other end.
